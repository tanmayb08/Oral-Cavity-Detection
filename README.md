# Oral-Cavity-Detection-

The cavity detection system running on a website and leveraging TensorFlow's object detection API represents a groundbreaking advancement in oral healthcare technology. This innovative system harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable early and accurate detection of cavities through a user-friendly online platform.

Users can easily upload dental images through the website's interface, which are then analyzed in real-time using TensorFlow's object detection algorithms. These algorithms are specifically trained to identify the characteristic patterns and features indicative of cavities within dental images. The system provides prompt feedback, highlighting potential cavities and their locations within the image, empowering users to take proactive steps towards addressing their oral health.

By integrating TensorFlow's object detection API, the system achieves high levels of accuracy and reliability in cavity detection, ensuring that even subtle signs of decay are not overlooked. Furthermore, the web-based nature of the platform enhances accessibility, allowing individuals to perform self-assessments of their oral health from the comfort of their own homes.

In summary, the cavity detection system represents a transformative approach to dental care, leveraging cutting-edge technology to facilitate early intervention and preventive measures. By combining the capabilities of TensorFlow's object detection API with the convenience of online accessibility, this system marks a significant step towards improving oral health outcomes for individuals worldwide.
